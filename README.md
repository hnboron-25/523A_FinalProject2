## Spatial Visualization of Glaciers Across High Mountain Asia (HMA) with Attention to Surge-type Glaciers
In this Shiny app, view data from the RGI 7.0 Glacier Product and examine spatial relationships of glaciers across HMA.

The app itself is in the **HMA_Surge_Glaciers** folder, and pulls data from a cleaned .csv named, **RGIcleaned.csv.**

Multiple tabs in the main pane switch between plots and maps to show how various types of glaciers in HMA differ or are similar to one another. 

Data from: RGI 7.0 Consortium, 2023. Randolph Glacier Inventory - A Dataset of Global Glacier Outlines, Version 7.0. Boulder, Colorado USA. NSIDC: National Snow and Ice Data Center. doi:10.5067/f6jmovy5navz. Online access: https://doi.org/10.5067/f6jmovy5navz.
